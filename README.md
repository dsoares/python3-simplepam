python3-simplepam
=================

An interface to the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) library on linux,
written in pure python (using ctypes)

Overview
--------

This module provides an ``authenticate`` function that allows the caller to
authenticate a given username / password against the PAM system on Linux.

Usage
-----

Run ``python3 setup.py install`` as root to install the module, then import the
``authenticate`` function, and use it as follows:

```python
    from simplepam import authenticate
    authenticate(username, password, service)
```

The full function signature is as follows:

```python
    authenticate(username, password, service='login', encoding='utf-8',
                 resetcred=True)
```

The ``service`` argument specifies the PAM service to authenticate against.
Defaults to ``login``.

``username``, ``password`` and ``service`` can be given as strings or bytes. If
they are strings, they will be encoded using the encoding given by the
``encoding`` parameter, or, if omitted, as UTF-8.

The function returns ``True`` if the authentication succeeds and returns
``False`` if authentication fails (or if PAM returns an error (FIXME)).
